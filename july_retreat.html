Everyone is invited to practice noble silence throughout the entire retreat, from our opening circle to our closing circle. Retreat leaders will speak during sessions to offer teachings and guidance in the practices but will also be in silence outside of the sessions. You are encouraged to ask written questions about your experience, the teachings or anything you need during our retreat. You’ll always be able to contact a retreat leader for support.</p><p>We begin our morning practice at 7am and end the day around 9pm. Fear not! Our meditation sessions start out shorter and build up during the weekend. There is a 3-hour break after lunch for you to explore nearby trails, journal, take a nap or rest. Three nourishing, vegetarian meals are offered daily by a local chef using seasonal produce that helps you have the best retreat possible, not only in your mind and heart but also in your belly.&nbsp;</p><p>A few times a day we practice Hatha Yoga – a gentle but deep meditative physical yoga practice in the style of Hridaya, the Yoga of the Spiritual Heart. Movements and poses are accessible for all bodies and give you even more tools to bring more awareness into your daily life through the body. Hridaya Yoga is distinct from other practices as it engages not only the physical body but the whole being. Postures and practices are performed with a focus on both the physical body and inner experience, turning physical practice into blissful meditation. If flow or vinyasa is your thing, there is also a time before dinner to do your own practice and those things that you know nourish you best.</p></div>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p>Every silent meditation retreat is different – even if you attend the exact same retreat multiple times. The most important attitude to have in a silent retreat is to let go of expectations. There are moments of challenge and moments of bliss in a meditation retreat, times of discomfort and times of joy. A spirit of openness to what unfolds is essential to welcoming a retreat experience.</p><p>Dmitry and Britt, your retreat leaders, have years of experience leading people through the personal transformation of yoga and meditation. We start with the basics of meditation and concentration techniques and build your understanding and experience throughout the weekend. Practices are accessible for beginning meditators and experienced meditators alike. You’ll learn how to listen to deeper parts of yourself – like that voice that’s been trying to be heard for years – through yoga, meditation, breathing exercises, daily life contemplation, spiritual curiosity, compassion and intentional integration.</p><p>You’ll leave with a renewed strength and momentum to develop a daily practice which keeps you more calm, centered and present than you’ve been before.</p><p>Our meditation retreat atmosphere is a safe space for you to try out different meditation and concentration practices, have a messy experience, and make notes of how you want to bring these practices into your life. There’s no expectation of perfectionism or that you can even sit still! Together we practice in silence while lengthening our meditations each day to build upon our stillness.. Your humanness is welcome – exactly as you are.</p><p>You’ll have the space to share your retreat experience on the last day and we highly encourage everyone to witness others’ process and share your experience. This is sometimes the most profound session of the whole weekend after being in silence with fellow seekers for three days.</p></div>

All religious backgrounds, faiths and lifestyles are welcome in the Spiritual Heart! The atmosphere is one of love and strong spiritual support.</p><p>No previous meditation or yoga experience is necessary as this silent retreat is designed for beginner and advanced meditators alike.</p><p>Using techniques from these vast, mystical traditions and Hridaya Yoga, we’ll learn how to create the best conditions for meditation including cultivating awareness, mental concentration, meditation techniques based on opening to the Spiritual Heart and how to apply these techniques in daily life. The last day will include integration techniques like how to create a home practice and maintain an open heart in the challenging moments of life.</p></div>

You are welcome to write notes to retreat leaders when you have questions or need assistance. Otherwise, we ask there to be no communication between guests, including not looking at other people’s faces, not making eye contact and not touching others. This may seem strict, but it opens the gateway to really focus internally, the whole point of a silent retreat. Once you get into the rhythm, you’ll be grateful for the space away from pleasing people or worrying about how they’ll react to you.</p><p>We ask all guests to maintain this noble silence throughout the retreat, which includes: <strong>no books, no electronics, no music, no phones or devices</strong> or other distractions. Again, this might feel extreme. The point is to not let yourself go to any distraction from what you’re really experiencing in the present moment. If taking a few days away from social media scares you, then you’re very ready for this journey.</p><p>We do encourage journaling to assist in the processing of your experience.</p><p>If you’ve never experienced the intimacy of silence – especially in today’s fast-paced, notification pinging, constant news driven, social media addicted, instant gratification world – you’ll never forget the spaciousness it brings. You’ll leave with more inner and outer love, tools to calm and center yourself, an understanding of what it means to let go, practices for deeper connection with other people, and the ability to be more present, conscious and to let go.</p><p>We hope you’ll join us for this special weekend dedicated to YOU.</p></div>

There is the also the opportunity to go deep in our internal world and not be distracted by the social conventions that usually turn the wheels of our mind constantly.<br><br>By observing outer silence and temporarily renouncing our usual habits of conversation, we provide a support for the cultivation of a deep inner silence. You will be asked to refrain not only from speaking, but also from using electronic devices. We will explain more and provide an opportunity for asking questions before going into silence. Be assured you will always have the opportunity to communicate by writing messages to Dmitry and Britt should the need arise. There will also be a daily Q&amp;A session.</p>
