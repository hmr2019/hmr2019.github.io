Her Yogic path began in 2005 when her sister dragged her to a Yoga class in Federal Way. She fell in love with savasana and came back just for relaxation.<br><br>In 2007, she was inspired to start teaching informally and since then has studied and taught in 6 countries and devoted her entire life to the journey of awakening. Grace completed the Hridaya Teacher Training in 2016 and is beyond grateful to have received the teachings of Advaita Tantra and the Spiritual Heart. She believes these teachings can transform the consciousness of anyone who practices them sincerely.<br><br>Grace’s favorite classes are those which deepen our consciousness and also incorporate how to live with more awareness, trust and compassion. She leads classes, discussion groups, workshops, women’s groups, and retreats in the Pacific Northwest and abroad with a focus on bringing a Yogic approach into every area of life. Through Yoga, she has found a deep sense of peace and trust, and hopes to share this in her teachings. More information can be found at her website, www.bewholebehappy.com.</span><br></p>
